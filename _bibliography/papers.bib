  title={Online Allocation with Replenishable Budgets: Worst Case and Beyond},
  author={Li, Pengfei and Yang, Jianyi and Islam, Mohammad J. and Ren, Shaolei},
  abstract={This paper studies online resource allocation with replenishable budgets, where budgets can be replenished
on top of the initial budget and an agent sequentially chooses online allocation decisions without violating the
available budget constraint at each round. We propose a novel online algorithm, called OACP (Opportunistic
Allocation with Conservative Pricing), that conservatively adjusts dual variables while opportunistically
utilizing available resources. OACP achieves a bounded asymptotic competitive ratio in adversarial settings as
the number of decision rounds T gets large. Importantly, the asymptotic competitive ratio of OACP is optimal
in the absence of additional assumptions on budget replenishment. To further improve the competitive ratio,
we make a mild assumption that there is budget replenishment every T* decision rounds and propose
OACP+ to dynamically adjust the total budget assignment for online allocation. Next, we move beyond the
worst-case and propose LA-OACP (Learning-Augmented OACP/OACP+), a novel learning-augmented algorithm
for online allocation with replenishable budgets. We prove that LA-OACP can improve the average utility
compared to OACP/OACP+ when the ML predictor is properly trained, while still offering worst-case utility
guarantees when the ML predictions are arbitrarily wrong. Finally, we run simulation studies of sustainable
AI inference powered by renewables, validating our analysis and demonstrating the empirical benefits of
LA-OACP.},

  abstract={This paper studies the problem of Anytime-Competitive Markov Decision Process (A-CMDP). Existing works on Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) aim to optimize the expected reward while constraining the expected cost over random dynamics, but the cost in a specific episode can still be unsatisfactorily high. In contrast, the goal of A-CMDP is to optimize the expected reward while guaranteeing a bounded cost in each round of any episode against a policy prior. We propose a new algorithm, called Anytime-Competitive Reinforcement Learning (ACRL), which provably guarantees the anytime cost constraints. The regret analysis shows the policy asymptotically matches the optimal reward achievable under the anytime competitive constraints. Experiments on the application of carbon-intelligent computing verify the reward performance and cost constraint guarantee of ACRL.},

  title={Learning for Edge-Weighted Online Bipartite Matching with Robustness Guarantees},
  author={Yang, Jianyi and Li, Pengfei and Wierman, Adam and Ren, Shaolei},
  abstract={Many problems, such as online ad display, can be formulated as online bipartite matching. 
The crucial challenge lies in the nature of sequentially- revealed online item information, 
based on which we make irreversible matching decisions at each step. While numerous expert online algorithms 
have been proposed with bounded worst-case competitive ratios, they may not offer satisfactory performance in average cases. 
On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to improve the average performance, 
but it lacks ro- bustness and can perform arbitrarily poorly. In this paper, we propose a novel RL-based approach 
to edge-weighted online bipartite matching with robustness guarantees (LOMAR), achieving both good average-case and
worst-case performance. The key novelty of LOMAR is a new online switch- ing operation which, based on a judicious 
condition to hedge against future uncertainties, decides whether to follow the expert’s decision or the RL decision 
for each online item. We prove that for any ρ ∈ [0, 1], LOMAR is ρ-competitive against any given expert online algorithm. 
To improve the average performance, we train the RL policy by explicitly considering the online switching operation. 
Finally, we run empirical experiments to demonstrate the advantages of LOMAR com- pared to existing baselines.},

  title={Learning-Assisted Algorithm Unrolling for Online Optimization with Inventory Constraints},
  author={Yang, Jianyi and Ren, Shaolei},
  abstract={Online optimization with multiple budget constraints is challenging since the online decisions 
over a short time horizon are coupled together by strict inventory constraints. The existing manually-designed algorithms 
cannot achieve sat- isfactory average performance for this setting because they often need a large number of time steps 
for convergence and/or may violate the inventory constraints. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning (ML) assisted unrolling approach, 
called LAAU (Learning-Assisted Algorithm Un- rolling), which unrolls the agent’s online decision pipeline and 
leverages an ML model for updating the Lagrangian mul- tiplier online. For efficient training via backpropagation, 
we derive gradients of the decision pipeline over time. We also provide the average cost bounds for two cases 
when training data is available offline and collected online, respectively. Finally, we present numerical results 
to highlight that LAAU can outperform the existing baselines.},

  title={Robustified Learning for Online Optimization with Memory Costs},
  author={Li, Pengfei and Yang, Jianyi and Ren, Shaolei},
  abstract={Online optimization with memory costs has many realworld applications, where sequential actions are made 
without knowing the future input. Nonetheless, the memory cost couples the actions over time, adding substantial challenges. 
Conventionally, this problem has been approached by various expert-designed online algorithms with the goal of achieving bounded worst-case competitive ratios,
but the resulting average performance is often unsatisfactory. On the other hand, emerging machine learning (ML) based optimizers 
can improve the average performance, but suffer from the lack of worst-case performance robustness. In this paper, 
we propose a novel expert-robustified learning (ERL) approach, achieving {both} good average performance and robustness. 
More concretely, for robustness, ERL introduces a novel projection operator that robustifies ML actions by utilizing 
an expert online algorithm; for average performance, ERL trains the ML optimizer based on a recurrent architecture 
by explicitly considering downstream expert robustification. We prove that, for any λ≥1, ERL can achieve λ-competitive 
against the expert algorithm and λ⋅C-competitive against the optimal offline algorithm (where C is the expert's competitive ratio). 
Additionally, we extend our analysis to a novel setting of multi-step memory costs. Finally, our analysis is 
supported by empirical experiments for an energy scheduling application.},

  abstract={By integrating domain knowledge with labeled samples, informed machine learning has been emerging to improve the learning performance for a wide range of applications. Nonetheless, rigorous understanding of the role of injected domain knowledge has been under-explored. In this paper, we consider an informed deep neural network (DNN) with over-parameterization and domain knowledge integrated into its training objective function, and study how and why domain knowledge benefits the performance. Concretely, we quantitatively demonstrate the two benefits of domain knowledge in informed learning {—} regularizing the label-based supervision and supplementing the labeled samples {—} and reveal the trade-off between label and knowledge imperfectness in the bound of the population risk. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose a generalized informed training objective to better exploit the benefits of knowledge and balance the label and knowledge imperfectness, which is validated by the population risk bound. Our analysis on sampling complexity sheds lights on how to choose the hyper-parameters for informed learning, and further justifies the advantages of knowledge informed learning.},

  title={Expert-Calibrated Learning for Online Optimization with Switching Costs},
  author={Li*, Pengfei and Yang*, Jianyi and Ren, Shaolei},
  abstract={We study online convex optimization with switching costs, a practically important but also extremely chal- lenging problem due to the lack of complete offline information. By tapping into the power of machine learning (ML) based optimizers, ML-augmented online algorithms (also referred to as expert calibration in this paper) have been emerging as state of the art, with provable worst-case performance guarantees. Nonetheless, by using the standard practice of training an ML model as a standalone optimizer and plugging it into an ML-augmented algorithm, the average cost performance can be highly unsatisfactory. In order to address the “how to learn” challenge, we propose EC-L2O (expert-calibrated learning to optimize), which trains an ML-based optimizer by explicitly taking into account the downstream expert calibrator. To accomplish this, we propose a new differentiable expert calibrator that generalizes regularized online balanced descent and offers a provably better competitive ratio than pure ML predictions when the prediction error is large. For training, our loss function is a weighted sum of two different losses — one minimizing the average ML prediction error for better robustness, and the other one minimizing the post-calibration average cost. We also provide theoretical analysis for EC-L2O, highlighting that expert calibration can be even beneficial for the average cost performance and that the high-percentile tail ratio of the cost achieved by EC-L2O to that of the offline optimal oracle (i.e., tail cost ratio) can be bounded. Finally, we test EC-L2O by running simulations for sustainable datacenter demand response. Our results demonstrate that EC-L2O can empirically achieve a lower average cost as well as a lower competitive ratio than the existing baseline algorithms.

  title={One Proxy Device Is Enough for Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search},
  author={Lu, Bingqian and Yang, Jianyi and Jiang, Weiwen and Shi, Yiyu and Ren, Shaolei},
  abstract={Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in numerous real-world applications such as vision-based autonomous driving and video content analysis. To run CNN inference on various target devices, hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) is crucial. A key requirement of efficient hardware-aware NAS is the fast evaluation of inference latencies in order to rank different architectures. While building a latency predictor for each target device has been commonly used in state of the art, this is a very time-consuming process, lacking scalability in the presence of extremely diverse devices. In this work, we address the scalability challenge by exploiting latency monotonicity -- the architecture latency rankings on different devices are often correlated. When strong latency monotonicity exists, we can re-use architectures searched for one proxy device on new target devices, without losing optimality. In the absence of strong latency monotonicity, we propose an efficient proxy adaptation technique to significantly boost the latency monotonicity. Finally, we validate our approach and conduct experiments with devices of different platforms on multiple mainstream search spaces, including MobileNet-V2, MobileNet-V3, NAS-Bench-201, ProxylessNAS and FBNet. Our results highlight that, by using just one proxy device, we can find almost the same Pareto-optimal architectures as the existing per-device NAS, while avoiding the prohibitive cost of building a latency predictor for each device. },

  title={Learning for Robust Combinatorial Optimization: Algorithm and Application},

  abstract={Learning to optimize (L2O) has recently emerged as a promising approach to solving optimization problems by exploiting the strong prediction power of neural networks and offering lower runtime complexity than conventional solvers. While L2O has been applied to various problems, a crucial yet challenging class of problems -- robust combinatorial optimization in the form of minimax optimization -- have largely remained under-explored. In addition to the exponentially large decision space, a key challenge for robust combinatorial optimization lies in the inner optimization problem, which is typically non-convex and entangled with outer optimization. In this paper, we study robust combinatorial optimization and propose a novel learning-based optimizer, called LRCO (Learning for Robust Combinatorial Optimization), which quickly outputs a robust solution in the presence of uncertain context. LRCO leverages a pair of learning-based optimizers -- one for the minimizer and the other for the maximizer -- that use their respective objective functions as losses and can be trained without the need of labels for training problem instances. To evaluate the performance of LRCO, we perform simulations for the task offloading problem in vehicular edge computing. Our results highlight that LRCO can greatly reduce the worst-case cost and improve robustness, while having a very low runtime complexity. },

  author={Lu, Bingqian and Yang, Jianyi and Xu, Jie and Ren, Shaolei},
  journal={IEEE Internet of Things Journal},
  abstract={Edge devices, including, in particular, mobile devices, have been emerging as an 
increasingly more important platform for deep neural network (DNN) inference. Typically, 
multiple lightweight DNN models generated using different architectures and/or compression schemes 
can fit into a device, thus selecting an optimal one is crucial in order to maximize the users’ 
Quality of Experience (QoE) for edge inference. The existing approaches to device-aware DNN 
optimization are usually time consuming and not scalable in view of extremely diverse edge devices. 
More importantly, they focus on optimizing standard performance metrics (e.g., accuracy and latency), 
which may not translate into improvement of the users’ actual subjective QoE. In this article,
we propose a novel automated and user-centric DNN selection engine, called Aquaman , 
which keeps users into a closed loop and leverages their QoE feedback to guide DNN selection decisions. 
The core of Aquaman is a neural network-based QoE predictor, which is continuously updated online. 
Additionally, we use neural bandit learning to balance exploitation and exploration, 
with a provably efficient QoE performance. Finally, we evaluate Aquaman on a 15-user experimental 
study as well as synthetic simulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of Aquaman .},

  abstract={A standard assumption in contextual multi-arm bandit is that the true context is perfectly known before arm selection.
Nonetheless, in many practical applications (e.g., cloud resource management), 
prior to arm selection, the context information can only be acquired by prediction 
subject to errors or adversarial modification. In this paper, we study a novel contextual 
bandit setting in which only imperfect context is available for arm selection while the true context 
is revealed at the end of each round. We propose two robust arm selection algorithms: MaxMinUCB 
(Maximize Minimum UCB) which maximizes the worst-case reward, and MinWD (Minimize Worst-case Degradation) 
which minimizes the worst-case regret. Importantly, we analyze the robustness of MaxMinUCB and MinWD by 
deriving both regret and reward bounds compared to an oracle that knows the true context. 
Our results show that as time goes on, MaxMinUCB and MinWD both perform as asymptotically well as 
their optimal counterparts that know the reward function. Finally, we apply MaxMinUCB and MinWD to 
online edge datacenter selection, and run synthetic simulations to validate our theoretical analysis.},

  title={Bandit Learning with Predicted Context: Regret Analysis and Selective Context Query},
  author={Yang, Jianyi and Ren, Shaolei},
  journal={IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications},
  abstract={Abstract—Contextual bandit learning selects actions (i.e., arms) 
based on context information to maximize rewards while balancing exploitation and exploration.
In many applications (e.g., cloud resource management with dynamic workloads), before arm selection, 
the agent/learner can either predict context information online based on context history or selectively
query the context from an outside expert. Motivated by this practical consideration, 
we study a novel contextual bandit setting where context information is either predicted online or queried from an expert. 
First, considering predicted context only, we quantify the impact of context prediction on the cumulative regret 
(compared to an oracle with perfect context information) by deriving an upper bound on regret, 
which takes the form of a weighted combination of regret incurred by standard bandit learning and the context 
prediction error. Then, inspired by the regret’s structural decomposition, we propose context query algorithms 
to selectively obtain outside expert’s input (subject to a total query budget) for more accurate context, 
decreasing the overall regret. Finally, we apply our algorithms to virtual machine scheduling on cloud platforms. 
The simulation results validate our regret analysis and shows the effectiveness of our selective context query algorithms.},

  journal={International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence},
  abstract={Contextual bandit is a classic multi-armed bandit setting, where side information (i.e., context) 
is available before arm selection. A standard assump- tion is that exact contexts are perfectly 
known prior to arm selection and only single feedback is re- turned. In this work, 
we focus on multi-feedback bandit learning with probabilistic contexts, 
where a bundle of contexts are revealed to the agent along with their corresponding probabilities at the 
beginning of each round. This models such scenarios as where contexts are drawn from the probability output 
of a neural network and the reward func- tion is jointly determined by multiple feedback signals. 
We propose a kernelized learning algorithm based on upper confidence bound to choose the optimal arm 
in reproducing kernel Hilbert space for each context bundle. Moreover, we theoretically establish an upper 
bound on the cumulative regret with respect to an oracle that knows the optimal arm given probabilistic contexts, 
and show that the bound grows sublinearly with time. Our simula- tion on machine learning model 
recommendation further validates the sub-linearity of our cumulative regret and 
demonstrates that our algorithm outperforms the approach that selects arms based on the most probable context.},
