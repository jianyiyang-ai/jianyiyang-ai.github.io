  title={Online Allocation with Replenishable Budgets: Worst Case and Beyond},
  author={Yang, Jianyi and Li, Pengfei and Mohammad J. Islam and Ren, Shaolei},
  abstract={This paper studies online resource allocation with replenishable budgets, where budgets can be replenished
on top of the initial budget and an agent sequentially chooses online allocation decisions without violating the
available budget constraint at each round. We propose a novel online algorithm, called OACP (Opportunistic
Allocation with Conservative Pricing), that conservatively adjusts dual variables while opportunistically
utilizing available resources. OACP achieves a bounded asymptotic competitive ratio in adversarial settings as
the number of decision rounds T gets large. Importantly, the asymptotic competitive ratio of OACP is optimal
in the absence of additional assumptions on budget replenishment. To further improve the competitive ratio,
we make a mild assumption that there is budget replenishment every T* decision rounds and propose
OACP+ to dynamically adjust the total budget assignment for online allocation. Next, we move beyond the
worst-case and propose LA-OACP (Learning-Augmented OACP/OACP+), a novel learning-augmented algorithm
for online allocation with replenishable budgets. We prove that LA-OACP can improve the average utility
compared to OACP/OACP+ when the ML predictor is properly trained, while still offering worst-case utility
guarantees when the ML predictions are arbitrarily wrong. Finally, we run simulation studies of sustainable
AI inference powered by renewables, validating our analysis and demonstrating the empirical benefits of
LA-OACP.},

  title={Anytime-Competitive Reinforcement Learning with Policy Prior},
  author={Yang, Jianyi and Li, Pengfei and Li, Tongxin and Wierman, Adam and Ren, Shaolei},
  abstract={This paper studies the problem of Anytime-Competitive Markov Decision Process (A-CMDP). Existing works on Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) aim to optimize the expected reward while constraining the expected cost over random dynamics, but the cost in a specific episode can still be unsatisfactorily high. In contrast, the goal of A-CMDP is to optimize the expected reward while guaranteeing a bounded cost in each round of any episode against a policy prior. We propose a new algorithm, called Anytime-Competitive Reinforcement Learning (ACRL), which provably guarantees the anytime cost constraints. The regret analysis shows the policy asymptotically matches the optimal reward achievable under the anytime competitive constraints. Experiments on the application of carbon-intelligent computing verify the reward performance and cost constraint guarantee of ACRL.},

  title={Informed Learning by Wide Neural Networks: Convergence, Generalization and Sampling Complexity},
  author={Yang, Jianyi and Ren, Shaolei},
  abstract={By integrating domain knowledge with labeled samples, informed machine learning has been emerging to improve the learning performance for a wide range of applications. Nonetheless, rigorous understanding of the role of injected domain knowledge has been under-explored. In this paper, we consider an informed deep neural network (DNN) with over-parameterization and domain knowledge integrated into its training objective function, and study how and why domain knowledge benefits the performance. Concretely, we quantitatively demonstrate the two benefits of domain knowledge in informed learning {—} regularizing the label-based supervision and supplementing the labeled samples {—} and reveal the trade-off between label and knowledge imperfectness in the bound of the population risk. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose a generalized informed training objective to better exploit the benefits of knowledge and balance the label and knowledge imperfectness, which is validated by the population risk bound. Our analysis on sampling complexity sheds lights on how to choose the hyper-parameters for informed learning, and further justifies the advantages of knowledge informed learning.},

  title={Expert-Calibrated Learning for Online Optimization with Switching Costs},
  author={Li*, Pengfei and Yang*, Jianyi and Ren, Shaolei},
  abstract={We study online convex optimization with switching costs, a practically important but also extremely chal- lenging problem due to the lack of complete offline information. By tapping into the power of machine learning (ML) based optimizers, ML-augmented online algorithms (also referred to as expert calibration in this paper) have been emerging as state of the art, with provable worst-case performance guarantees. Nonetheless, by using the standard practice of training an ML model as a standalone optimizer and plugging it into an ML-augmented algorithm, the average cost performance can be highly unsatisfactory. In order to address the “how to learn” challenge, we propose EC-L2O (expert-calibrated learning to optimize), which trains an ML-based optimizer by explicitly taking into account the downstream expert calibrator. To accomplish this, we propose a new differentiable expert calibrator that generalizes regularized online balanced descent and offers a provably better competitive ratio than pure ML predictions when the prediction error is large. For training, our loss function is a weighted sum of two different losses — one minimizing the average ML prediction error for better robustness, and the other one minimizing the post-calibration average cost. We also provide theoretical analysis for EC-L2O, highlighting that expert calibration can be even beneficial for the average cost performance and that the high-percentile tail ratio of the cost achieved by EC-L2O to that of the offline optimal oracle (i.e., tail cost ratio) can be bounded. Finally, we test EC-L2O by running simulations for sustainable datacenter demand response. Our results demonstrate that EC-L2O can empirically achieve a lower average cost as well as a lower competitive ratio than the existing baseline algorithms.

  title={One Proxy Device Is Enough for Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search},
  author={Lu, Bingqian and Yang, Jianyi and Jiang, Weiwen and Shi, Yiyu and Ren, Shaolei},
  abstract={Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in numerous real-world applications such as vision-based autonomous driving and video content analysis. To run CNN inference on various target devices, hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) is crucial. A key requirement of efficient hardware-aware NAS is the fast evaluation of inference latencies in order to rank different architectures. While building a latency predictor for each target device has been commonly used in state of the art, this is a very time-consuming process, lacking scalability in the presence of extremely diverse devices. In this work, we address the scalability challenge by exploiting latency monotonicity -- the architecture latency rankings on different devices are often correlated. When strong latency monotonicity exists, we can re-use architectures searched for one proxy device on new target devices, without losing optimality. In the absence of strong latency monotonicity, we propose an efficient proxy adaptation technique to significantly boost the latency monotonicity. Finally, we validate our approach and conduct experiments with devices of different platforms on multiple mainstream search spaces, including MobileNet-V2, MobileNet-V3, NAS-Bench-201, ProxylessNAS and FBNet. Our results highlight that, by using just one proxy device, we can find almost the same Pareto-optimal architectures as the existing per-device NAS, while avoiding the prohibitive cost of building a latency predictor for each device. },
