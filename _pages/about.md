I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [UC, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu) and a visiting researcher at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu), working with [Prof. Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com) and [Prof. Shaolei Ren](https://shaoleiren.github.io).

Prior of that, I received my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at University of California, Riverside, advised by [Prof. Shaolei Ren](https://shaoleiren.github.io). I graduated from [BUPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_University_of_Posts_and_Telecommunications) with M.S. and [Xidian University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xidian_University) with B.E.

My research lies in machine learning algorithms and their applications in sustainable AI systems.  On the one hand, my research focus on pricipled **learning-augmented algorithms**, utilizing domain knowledge (e.g. existing policy/algorithms, system models, optimization theory) to provide performance guarantees for real AI deployments. On the other hand, my research designs learning-based methods to address the online resource allocation and decision-making problems in achieving **sustainable AI** systems.
