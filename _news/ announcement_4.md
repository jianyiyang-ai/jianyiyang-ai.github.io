Our paper [Online Allocation with Replenishable Budgets: Worst Case and Beyond]() is accepted by **ACM SIGMETRICS 2023**! Online resource allocation with replenishments is one of the key problems for carbon neutral and/or water self-sufficient computing and is important for network resource management, online advertising, etc.  This paper provides fundamental algorithms with worst-case guarantees for this problem and proposes a learning-augmented algorithm to improve the statistical performance under worst-case guarantee.
